Description: # PyRgbDriverKit - README
        
        Copyright 2016-2017, RGB Photonics GmbH
        
        This software is a preliminary version. Function calls and parameters may
        change without notice.
        
        The package 'pyrgbdriverkit' is intended to run on GNU/Linux systems using
        Python. It allows to communicate with spectrometers from RGB Photonics.
        
        
        ## Remarks
        
        Currently the preliminary version has some limitations:
        
        * Only new Qseries devices with a USB Type-C connector such as Qmini2 are supported.
        * Device Qred is not yet supported.
        
        The preliminary version is intended to be used with Python 3. As Python 3.x is
        the present and future of the language, and virtually all scientific packages
        now support Python 3 as well, we will focus on Python 3. Although we try hard
        to also provide backwards compatibility for Python 2.7.
        
        Please make sure to update the firmware of your Qseries devices to the latest
        version.
        
        
        ## Installing pyrgbdriverkit on GNU/Linux Systems
        
        These instructions are for Debian-based systems. Instruction for other flavors
        of GNU/Linux should be similar.
        
        1) Install Python with elevated access rights
        
           $ sudo apt-get install python
        
        2) Make sure at least one of the supported libraries (libusb 1.0, libusb 0.1 or
           OpenUSB) are installed. We recommend libusb 1.0 as a backend which can be
           installed with this command:
        
           $ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0
        
        3) Once the above packages are installed, you can untar the pyrgbdriverkit
           software bundle.
        
           $ tar xzf pyrgbdriverkit-[version].tar.gz
        
        4) To install the pyrgbdriverkit Python package from source code run the command
           as root within the same directory as this README file.
        
           $ sudo python setup.py install
        
           It is also possible to install the archive file directly with pip
           (https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):
        
           $ sudo pip install pyrgbdriverkit-[version].tar.gz
        
           Using pip also provides an easy way to uninstall or update the package.
        
        5) Before using any device, the application or rather the user needs permission
           to access it. This can be achieved by copying the udev rule located in the
           package directory etc/
        
           $ sudo cp etc/51-rgbdevices.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
        
           You might load the new rules afterwards:
        
           $ sudo udevadm control --reload
           $ sudo udevadm trigger
        
           This rule will allow users in the 'users' group to access Qseries devices
           such as Qmini2 or Qred. (This might not be necessary on MacOS.)
        
        
        ## Uninstalling this module
        
        To uninstall this module you need to find out what files were installed and
        then use that list to remove those files:
        
        $ sudo python setup.py install --record install-files.txt
        $ cat install-files.txt | sudo xargs rm -rf
        
        (Remember to run the commands within the same directory as this README file.)
        
        If pip was used to install the package it can be removed with:
        
        $ pip uninstall pyrgbdriverkit
        
        
        ## Additional information
        
        If you encounter the following error it is an indicator that you have not
        properly set permissions to access the device with the current user:
        
        usb.core.USBError: [Errno 13] Access denied (insufficient permissions)
        
        A first test to see if the device appears correctly is to check if the symlink
        specified in the udev rule is created. The %k operator in the udev rules
        evaluates to the kernel name for the device, e.g. /dev/qseries-qmini-x-x.x
        
        $ ls -l /dev/qseries*
        
        
        ## Usage of pyrgbdriverkit
        
        To test the installation open a bash shell and type:
        
        > python
        > import rgbdriverkit
        > rgbdriverkit.__version__
        
        This should print the version of the installed package.
        
        A demo called simple_spectrometer.py is provided for a first starting point.
        Please note that the demo needs matplotlib for saving the spectrum to a file
        if you have set 'main(save_plot=True)'.
        All examples are located in the 'examples' folder of the .tar.gz archive file.
        
        
        ## Get Help
        
        The built-in function help() invokes the online help system in the interactive interpreter:
        
        > help(rgbdriverkit)
        or
        > help(rgbdriverkit.qseriesdriver)
        
        Please note that you have to import the appropriate modules.
